STATEMENT ΟΝ ΒυΡΙ-ΙΟΑΤΕ tMAGEs

This reei of microfiim contains materiai
which hes peper coior changes, stains or
illustrations (some of which may appear on
peges mixed with printed text). in order to

ensure that aii text end illustrations are
legitote, exposure settjnsqs must be changed.

Theretore‚ when text and illustratione, exist
in a single image or when materiei
bacquounds differ, such tremes may need
to be exposed twice.

The first exposure reflects the camere
operator’s best effort to capture tite majority
of the text; the second exposure refiects the

camera operator’s best effert to capture

iliustretive materiei or trie remaining text. it
is hoped that titis practice witi resuit in a
microfiim product that fuiiy serves trie needs
of most researchers.
